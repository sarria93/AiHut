        <p class="hidden bloque">Suno is a web-based, text-to-music generator that can whip up full songs in seconds from a simple text prompt. For example, tell it to make a 'psychedelic UK garage song about a friend with a Nokia obsession', and you'll get a couple of two-minute songs complete with vocals, instrumentation, lyrics, a song title and even artwork.</p>

        <h2>Limitations of Suno</h2>
        <p> While Suno AI stands out for the quality of its musical outputs, it has its limitations. The songs it produces are catchy and employ rhyming lyrics, but they fall short of the profoundness found in the works of acclaimed artists like Bob Dylan. The compositions created by Suno AI are often simplistic, similar to many chart-topping songs.

            Suno AI’s shortcomings extend beyond its limited musical vocabulary. The software occasionally experiences what the developers describe as “hallucinations,” and its repertoire is still relatively narrow. Though it is familiar with major genres like pop, jazz, hip-hop, rock’n’roll, and classical music, Suno AI struggles to meet specific requests with precision.

    <h2>How Suno Works</h2>
    <p>With Suno AI, creating songs using a text prompt is as simple as telling a story. You just type in your ideas or how you’re feeling into the program. You could write something like, “I want a song that makes me feel brave,” or describe a scene, “A quiet forest with a soft stream running through.” Suno AI takes these prompts and uses its magic to make your words into music.</p>
    <p>Suno AI is able to analyse the words or the lyrics passed through it using the text prompt. Then, it uses deep learning techniques to compose and develop an original tune that reflects the emotions associated with those words, with the right option.</p>
    <p>    It uses two primary models for music generation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bark, which is specialised for human singing voices and lyrics</li>
        <li> Chirp, which is specialised for the instrumental part.</li>
</ul>

   <img class="cuepoImg" src="../images/Suno/how.it.works.webp" alt="">
    
   <p>You can check the AI model first-hand on Suno AI’s Discord server, where you can use the /chirp command to get started with the text prompt. The AI model will then generate an original composition around those lyrics.

    The Suno AI model is able to generate the vocal composition and music in separate tracks, which then combine into the final song. The more specific details your prompt provides, the closer Suno AI can get to producing the exact music you are looking for.</p>

        <h2>Overcoming Technological Challenges</h2>

        <p>Making music from text is really hard. Unlike making pictures or writing, music needs to flow smoothly and feel right. Here’s what the Suno team had to do:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Figure out how to turn continuous sound waves into something a computer can understand, instead of just dealing with simple things like words or pictures.</li>
            <li>Learn the complex patterns of music, such as rhythm and melody, and how they all fit together.</li>
            <li>Make sure this can all work on a big scale, so lots of people can use it without problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This hard work means Suno can create music that sounds like it was made by a professional.</p>
