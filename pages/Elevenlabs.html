    <h2>How ElevenLabs works</h2>

    <p >ElevenLabs offers a user-friendly platform powered by advanced speech synthesis, deep learning, and text to speech AI technology. To use ElevenLabs, I simply input or upload text, choose from a variety of voice and language options, and instantly generate humanlike speech. I can also use the platform’s editing interface to adjust the voice settings such as pitch, tone, pronunciation, volume, clarity, or stability of the voice over to suit my personal preferences. In addition to the voice library that features over 120 preset voices, I also cloned my own voice for one of the projects. This was also straightforward. I simply uploaded a small sample of my voice and hit “add voice.” I could then use this voice to create instant voice overs that sounded just like me.
